This is the code for a web app that I used to deploy an Image Classifier.

This Image Classifier was named 'The Kissing Booth 2' after the popular netflix movie.

The idea behind the web app was that if Convolutional Neural Networks are so good at classification images then what if we used them to answer the question on what member of a cast from a very popular movie, they look like. Using the probability as the metrics on how much similar they look like.

The Dataset on which the model was trained on consisted of 2259 images with 10 categories. The model was trained using the DenseNet121 CNN Architecture.

This is the second Computer Vision project that I have worked on where all the data used was straight away scrapped from Public accounts of the people and from google images. I do not own the rights to any of these images but if you want to use them the link is below:
